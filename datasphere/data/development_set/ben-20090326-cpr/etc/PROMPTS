ben-20090326-cpr/mfc/b0137 BUT THIS LITTLE DEFECT DID NOT WORRY HIM
ben-20090326-cpr/mfc/b0138 AND THEN STEADILY HE BEGAN TO CHEW
ben-20090326-cpr/mfc/b0139 TOGETHER THEY ATE THE RABBIT
ben-20090326-cpr/mfc/b0140 THEY EDGED NEARER AND STOOD SHOULDER TO SHOULDER FACING THEIR WORLD
ben-20090326-cpr/mfc/b0141 IT WAS BEATING AND WAITING IN THE AMBUSH OF THOSE BLACK PITS

ben-20090326-cpr/mfc/b0143 IT TOOK HIM HALF AN HOUR TO REACH THE EDGE OF IT
ben-20090326-cpr/mfc/b0144 BUT THERE WAS NO LONGER THE MOTHER YEARNING IN HIS HEART
