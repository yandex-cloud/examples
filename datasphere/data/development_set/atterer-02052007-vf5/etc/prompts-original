vf5-01 Take away their foreman and they wouldn't be worth their grub
vf5-02 That's the sub-foreman, explained Thorpe
vf5-03 Philip made no effort to follow
vf5-04 He came first a year ago, and revealed himself to Jeanne
vf5-05 They are to attack your camp tomorrow night
vf5-06 Two days ago Jeanne learned where her father's men were hiding
vf5-07 I was near the cabin, and saw you
vf5-08 Low bush whipped him in the face and left no sting
vf5-09 Suddenly Jeanne stopped for an instant
vf5-10 There was none of the joy of meeting in his face
vf5-11 And when you come back in a few days, bring Eileen
vf5-12 Gregson had left the outer door slightly ajar
vf5-13 The date was nearly eighteen years old
vf5-14 They were the presage of storm
vf5-15 Down there the earth was already swelling with life
vf5-16 For the first time in his life he was yearning for a scrap
vf5-17 She had been thoroughly and efficiently mauled
vf5-18 Every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated
vf5-19 Tomorrow I'm going after that bear, he said
vf5-20 If not, let's say our prayers and go to bed
vf5-21 So cheer up, and give us your paw
vf5-22 This time he did not yap for mercy
vf5-23 And the air was growing chilly
vf5-24 Don't you see, I'm chewing this thing in two
vf5-25 The questions may have come vaguely in his mind
vf5-26 Like a flash he launched himself into the feathered mass of the owl
vf5-27 Ahead of them they saw a glimmer of sunshine
vf5-28 Two gigantic owls were tearing at the carcass
vf5-29 The big-eyed, clucking moose-birds were most annoying
vf5-30 Next to them the Canada jays were most persistent
vf5-31 For a time the exciting thrill of his adventure was gone
vf5-32 He did not rush in
vf5-33 It was edged with ice
vf5-34 He drank of the water cautiously
vf5-35 But a strange thing happened
vf5-36 He began to follow the footprints of the dog
vf5-37 Such a dog the wise driver kills, or turns loose
vf5-38 Sometimes her dreams were filled with visions
vf5-39 Thus had the raw wilderness prepared him for this day
vf5-40 He leapt again, and the club caught him once more
