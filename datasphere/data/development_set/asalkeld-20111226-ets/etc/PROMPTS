asalkeld-20111226-ets/mfc/a0147 A MOMENT BEFORE HE WAS INTOXICATED BY A JOY THAT WAS ALMOST MADNESS
asalkeld-20111226-ets/mfc/a0148 NOW THESE THINGS HAD BEEN STRUCK DEAD WITHIN HIM
asalkeld-20111226-ets/mfc/a0149 FOR AN INSTANT HE SAW PIERRE DRAWN LIKE A SILHOUETTE AGAINST THE SKY
asalkeld-20111226-ets/mfc/a0150 GOODBYE PIERRE HE SHOUTED
asalkeld-20111226-ets/mfc/a0151 AND MACDOUGALL WAS BEYOND THE TRAIL AND WITH THREE WEEKS TO SPARE
asalkeld-20111226-ets/mfc/a0152 PHILIP THRUST HIMSELF AGAINST IT AND ENTERED
asalkeld-20111226-ets/mfc/a0153 MACDOUGALL TAPPED HIS FOREHEAD SUSPICIOUSLY WITH A STUBBY FOREFINGER
asalkeld-20111226-ets/mfc/a0154 HE WAS SMOOTH-SHAVEN AND HIS HAIR AND EYES WERE BLACK
asalkeld-20111226-ets/mfc/a0155 WON'T YOU DRAW UP GENTLEMEN
asalkeld-20111226-ets/mfc/a0156 A STRANGE FIRE BURNED IN HIS EYES WHEN THORPE TURNED
