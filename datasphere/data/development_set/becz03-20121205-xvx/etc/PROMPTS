becz03-20121205-xvx/mfc/a0138 IN THE PICTURE HE SAW EACH MOMENT A GREATER RESEMBLANCE TO JEANNE
becz03-20121205-xvx/mfc/a0139 HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT AS HE WASHED HIMSELF AND GROOMED HIS DISHEVELED CLOTHES
becz03-20121205-xvx/mfc/a0140 ACCEPT A FATHER'S BLESSING AND WITH IT THIS
becz03-20121205-xvx/mfc/a0141 IT SEEMS LIKE A STRANGE POINTING OF THE HAND OF GOD
becz03-20121205-xvx/mfc/a0142 SUCH THINGS HAD OCCURRED BEFORE HE TOLD PHILIP
becz03-20121205-xvx/mfc/a0143 AH I HAD FORGOTTEN HE EXCLAIMED
becz03-20121205-xvx/mfc/a0144 BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING EVEN MORE STARTLING THAN THIS RESEMBLANCE
becz03-20121205-xvx/mfc/a0145 I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OF THEM AS THEY TEAR VERY EASILY
becz03-20121205-xvx/mfc/a0146 OF COURSE THAT IS UNINTERESTING SHE CONTINUED
becz03-20121205-xvx/mfc/a0147 A MOMENT BEFORE HE WAS INTOXICATED BY A JOY THAT WAS ALMOST MADNESS
