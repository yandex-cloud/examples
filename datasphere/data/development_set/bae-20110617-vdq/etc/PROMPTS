bae-20110617-vdq/mfc/a0131 PROVIDENCE HAD DELIVERED HIM THROUGH THE MAELSTROM
bae-20110617-vdq/mfc/a0132 A CRY OF JOY BURST FROM PHILIP'S LIPS
bae-20110617-vdq/mfc/a0133 PHILIP BEGAN TO FEEL THAT HE HAD FOOLISHLY OVERESTIMATED HIS STRENGTH
bae-20110617-vdq/mfc/a0134 HE OBEYED THE PRESSURE OF HER HAND
bae-20110617-vdq/mfc/a0135 I AM GOING TO SURPRISE FATHER AND YOU WILL GO WITH PIERRE
bae-20110617-vdq/mfc/a0136 ABOUT HIM EVERYWHERE WERE THE EVIDENCES OF LUXURY AND OF AGE
bae-20110617-vdq/mfc/a0137 THEN HE STEPPED BACK WITH A LOW CRY OF PLEASURE
bae-20110617-vdq/mfc/a0138 IN THE PICTURE HE SAW EACH MOMENT A GREATER RESEMBLANCE TO JEANNE
bae-20110617-vdq/mfc/a0139 HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT AS HE WASHED HIMSELF AND GROOMED HIS DISHEVELED CLOTHES
bae-20110617-vdq/mfc/a0140 ACCEPT A FATHER'S BLESSING AND WITH IT THIS
