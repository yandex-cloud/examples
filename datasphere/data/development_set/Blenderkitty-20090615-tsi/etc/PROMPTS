Blenderkitty-20090615-tsi/mfc/a0455 I OBEYED AND A MINUTE OR TWO LATER THEY STOOD BEFORE HIM
Blenderkitty-20090615-tsi/mfc/a0456 BUT IT WON'T CONTINUE SHE SAID WITH EASY CONFIDENCE
Blenderkitty-20090615-tsi/mfc/a0457 WHAT I SAW I COULD NOT AT FIRST BELIEVE
Blenderkitty-20090615-tsi/mfc/a0458 THE STOUT WOOD WAS CRUSHED LIKE AN EGGSHELL
Blenderkitty-20090615-tsi/mfc/a0459 THERE'S TOO MUCH OF THE SCHOOLBOY IN ME
Blenderkitty-20090615-tsi/mfc/a0460 I HAD FORGOTTEN THEIR EXISTENCE
Blenderkitty-20090615-tsi/mfc/a0461 AH WE WERE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER IN THAT MOMENT
Blenderkitty-20090615-tsi/mfc/a0462 BUT SHE SWUNG OBEDIENTLY ON HER HEEL INTO THE WIND
Blenderkitty-20090615-tsi/mfc/a0463 THEY ARE HIS TONGUE BY WHICH HE MAKES HIS KNOWLEDGE ARTICULATE
Blenderkitty-20090615-tsi/mfc/a0464 BETWEEN THE RUSH OF THE CASCADES STREAKS OF RUST SHOWED EVERYWHERE
