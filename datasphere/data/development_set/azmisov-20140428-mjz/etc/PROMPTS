azmisov-20140428-mjz/mfc/a0121 THEY ATE DINNER AT THE FIFTH AND RESTED FOR TWO HOURS
azmisov-20140428-mjz/mfc/a0122 TWO YEARS AGO I GAVE UP CIVILIZATION FOR THIS
azmisov-20140428-mjz/mfc/a0123 SHE HAD DIED FROM COLD AND STARVATION
azmisov-20140428-mjz/mfc/a0124 IT WAS JEANNE SINGING SOFTLY OVER BEYOND THE ROCKS
azmisov-20140428-mjz/mfc/a0125 HE WAS DETERMINED NOW TO MAINTAIN A MORE CERTAIN HOLD UPON HIMSELF
azmisov-20140428-mjz/mfc/a0126 EACH DAY SHE BECAME A MORE VITAL PART OF HIM
azmisov-20140428-mjz/mfc/a0127 IT WAS A TEMPTATION BUT HE RESISTED IT
azmisov-20140428-mjz/mfc/a0128 THIS ONE HOPE WAS DESTROYED AS QUICKLY AS IT WAS BORN
azmisov-20140428-mjz/mfc/a0129 HER FACE WAS AGAINST HIS BREAST
azmisov-20140428-mjz/mfc/a0130 SHE WAS HIS NOW FOREVER
