bebe-20100419-nrh/mfc/b0505 HOW VALIANTLY I WENT AT IT THAT FIRST DAY
bebe-20100419-nrh/mfc/b0506 IT WOULD HELP TO TIDE ME ALONG UNTIL I GOT STEADY EMPLOYMENT
bebe-20100419-nrh/mfc/b0507 DID I POSSESS TOO MUCH VITALITY
bebe-20100419-nrh/mfc/b0508 IN HIS ANXIETY AND SOLICITUDE AND LOVE THEY DID NOT COUNT
bebe-20100419-nrh/mfc/b0509 HE HAD FULFILLED HIS DUTY AND PAID PROPERLY

bebe-20100419-nrh/mfc/b0511 DO YOU VALUE YOUR HIDE
