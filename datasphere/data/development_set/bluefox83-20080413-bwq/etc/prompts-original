rai0001 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW 
rai0002 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF LIGHT WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS 
rai0003 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE 
rai0004 AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON 
rai0005 THERE IS ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END 
rai0006 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH 
rai0007 HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW 
rai0008 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS 
rai0009 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATIONS TO THE HEBREWS 
rai0010 IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS 
rai0011 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN 
rai0012 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY 
rai0013 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY 
rai0014 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN 
rai0015 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION BUT REFRACTION 
rai0016 BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED 
rai0017 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS 
rai0018 AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES 
rai0019 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF SUPER IMPOSITION 
rai0020 OF A NUMBER OF BOWS IF THE RED 
rai0021 OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST THE 
rai0022 RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH A ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND 
rai0023 SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW 
rai0024 THIS IS NOT THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW 
rai0025 ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
